\subsubsection{Stimuli for the number-agreement task (NA-task)}
This section describes the generation process of synthetic sentence stimuli for the number-agreement task (NA-task). These sets of stimuli were used to evaluate the performance of both full- and ablated models on the NA-task. Each NA-task contained sentences with a fixed syntactic structure, such as "Det Noun Adv Verb" or "Det Noun P Det Noun Verb", and each task was composed of several \textit{conditions} depending on the possible assignments of grammatical number to the nonu(s) in the sentence. For example, one NA-task contained sentences of the form: "Det Noun Verb", and had two conditions corresponding to the two possible number values of its noun. So the first conditiond such as "The boy runs", and the ablated network was tested on predicting the correct verb form. This task had two conditions, corresponding to the two possible assignments of grammatical number (singular or plural) to the main noun. Another NA-task contained sentences of the form: "Det Noun-1 P Det Noun-1 Verb", such as "The boy behind the girls jumps". This task had four conditions, corresponding to the four possible assignments of grammatical number to noun-1 and noun-2.


The network was evaluated on predicting the correct verb form (singular or plural).
