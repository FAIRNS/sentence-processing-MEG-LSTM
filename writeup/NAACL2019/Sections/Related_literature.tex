\subsection{Interpreting LSTM networks}
Short survey of works that:
- Interpret neural networks in general (e.g., CNNs in vision)
- Interpret LSTMs (e.g. Karpathy's)
- Interpret LSTM language models

\subsection{Subject-verb agreement in English}
- Subject-verb agreement from psycholinguistics (e.g., Miller and Bock, Franck and Rizzi)
- SV agreemnt in LSTMs (Linzen 2016, Gulordava 2018, etc.). 
- Relate to Nelson et. al 2017 PNAS, an intracranial study that identifies electrodes whose high-gamma activity correlates with syntactic tree-depth (numnber of open nodes)
