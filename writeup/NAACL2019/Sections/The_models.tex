\section{The models}
I would describe in this section the regression and language models. 


\subsection{LSTM language model}
\subsubsection{Architecture and dynamics}
TODOs:
- Number and type (embedding, LSTM, softmax) of layers, including dimensions. 
- Describe the dynamics of the network (list of equations of the LSTM)

\subsubsection{Model training and evaluation}
- Task (refer to Gulordava et. al)
- Describe and give (nick) names for the other models, e.g., LM-high-dropout, LM-SEED1
- The model was evaulated on a left-out test set...perplexity..

\subsection{Regression model}
- Explain that the model was used to predict the depth of the syntactic tree from network activity
\subsubsection{Model description}
- Describe the Features: network activity (hidden/cell activity)
- Describe the label: Tree depth (refer to the section describing the synthetic data)
- Describe the model: A Ridge/LASSO model.
\subsubsection{Model training and evalution}
- Model training: nested 5-fold CV procedure. Train/val/test. Optimal regularization size was estimated from the validation set (report optimal lamda - figures in FAIRNS.pdf on slack)
- model evaluation: R-squared on test set. Report resulting values (text+figures in FAIRNS.pdf).
