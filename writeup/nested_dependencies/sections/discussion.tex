\section{General Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item briefly reiterate on the main findings 
    \item Humans-NLM comparison 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A more `serious' discussion about what we take from the comparison. Be clear that The NLM is after all only a toy model. We argue for a coarse similarity.
        \item The sparsity in humans could thus be more gradual.   
        \item The short-range mechanism could be different. 
        \item comprehension vs. production.
    \end{itemize}
      
    \item Interference in the model. In particular, discuss the discrepancy between humans and NLMs wrt subject-congruence effect on the main subject. Consider discussing LR-SR interference and a simple analysis (with a figure in SM).
    \item In light of other models -
    \begin{itemize}
        \item subsection for each family of models: feature percolation, retrieval theories, DLT. 
        \item NLM as a possible implementation of higher-level, symbolic-based, theories such as the ACR-T.
        \item shortcoming of the NLM compared to other models: cross dependencies, OR/SC, etc. 
        \item Merits of the NLM model compared to other models.    
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Future directions. 
    
\end{itemize}
