\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


Start with general summary discussing Table \ref{tab:summary}.  Then,
proceed to discuss our results in light of theories of sentence
processing, considering both what has been proposed specifically in
the literature about agreement (I don't think there is a prediction
like ours) and in more general approaches to sentence processing, that
might also explain our results, but require a lot more assumptions
than NLMs. On the other hand, NLMs only provide a
rough match to human results. Future direction: can we understand
the differences?
