\subsection{Number-Agreement Tasks}
We construct six \emph{number-agreement (NA)} tasks: two for the ablation studies, with a single long-range dependency, and four NA-tasks for the nesting experiments, having two long-range dependencies (Figrure \ref{fig:design}). We give a short description of these tasks below. Table~\ref{tab:na-tasks-overview} provides an overview on all tasks. 

\input{tables/table_NA_tasks}

\paragraph{Tasks for the Ablation Experiments} For the ablation studies, we construct NA-tasks with a single long-range dependency across a prepositional phrase \citep{lakretz2019emergence}. To identify long-range number units, we use NounPP-number (Table~\ref{tab:na-tasks-overview}), in which the main subject and verb agree on grammatical number, and a second noun (attractor) can interfere during sentence processing. To identify long-range gender units, we use NounPP-gender, in which the main subject and a predicative adjective agree on gender, and an attractor having an opposite gender can interfere in the middle. 

\paragraph{Tasks for the Nesting Experiments} For the nesting experiments, we use four different NA-tasks. All tasks contain two subject-verb dependencies; they differ in terms of whether these dependencies are \emph{successive} or \emph{nested} and whether the embedded dependency is \emph{short-} or \emph{long-range}. Two subject-verb dependencies are \emph{successive} when the second noun occurs only after the first has been resolved. 
Such dependencies occur, for instance, in declarative sentences with a sentential complement, such as ``Il \textbf{ragazzo} \textbf{dice} che la \textit{donna conosce} il cane'' (``The \textbf{boy says} that the \emph{woman knows} the dog'').
In this example, the subject and verb are directly adjacent in both dependencies.
We thus call these dependencies \emph{short-range}, and the above sentence is an example of a sentence that could occur in the \emph{Short-Successive} NA-task. 
To create sentences that have a successive but \emph{long-range} subject-verb relationships, we increase the distance between the second noun and its corresponding verb by inserting a prepositional phrase in between them: ``Il \textbf{ragazzo} \textbf{dice} che la \textit{donna} accanto al \underline{figlio} \textit{conosce} il cane' '(``The \textbf{boy says} that the \emph{woman} next to the \underline{son} \emph{knows} the dog''). For nested dependencies, we consider sentences with object-relative clauses, such as ``Il \textbf{ragazzo} che la \emph{figlia} \emph{ama} \textbf{conosce} il contadino'' (``The \textbf{boy} who the \emph{daughter} \emph{loves} \textbf{knows} the farmer'').
As the nested dependency in this sentence is short range, we call the corresponding number-agreement task \emph{Short-Nested}.
For \emph{Long-Nested}, we again use prepositional phrases to increase the distance between the subject and verb of the nested dependency: ``Il \textbf{ragazzo} che la \emph{figlia} vicino alla \underline{donna} \emph{ama} \textbf{conosce} il contadino'' (``The \textbf{boy} who the \emph{daughter} near the \underline{woman} \emph{loves} \textbf{knows} the farmer'').

% \paragraph{NounPP} To establish the presence of long-range \emph{number} units, we create an Italian version of \citeauthor{lakretz2019emergence}'s \citeyear{lakretz2019emergence} NounPP task.
% This data set consists of 4000 sentences in which the subject is separated from the main verb by a prepositional phrase.
% I.e., an example of a sentence in this dataset, which we dub \emph{NounPP}, is ``il \textbf{ragazzo} accanto alla \underline{donna} \textbf{conosce} \ldots'' (the \textbf{boy} next to the \underline{woman} \textbf{knows}).
% We systematically vary the number of both the subject and the noun in the prepositional phrase (also referred to with the term \emph{attractor}), resulting in four different conditions: singular-singular (SS), singular-plural (SP), plural-singular (PS) and plural-plural (PP).
% For all of these conditions, we generate 1000 sentences by randomly sampling (object and subject) nouns, verbs and prepositions from a list of options, reported in Table \ref{}.\dnote{I just realise that this is only true for the NLM experiments, where would we like to report these numbers.}
% \dieuwke{Should we say something about ensuring that sentences are at least somewhat semantically acceptable, i.e. excluding sentences like ``Il figlio sotto il cane \ldots''}

% \paragraph{NounPP-gender}
% To investigate if the model has long-range \emph{gender} units, we adapt the NounPP task to end with a predicative adjective.
% For example: ``il \textbf{ragazzo} accanto alla \underline{donna} \`{e} \textbf{basso} (the \textbf{boy} next to the \underline{woman} is \textbf{short}).
% In this NA-task, which we call \emph{NounPP-gender}, we focus on the adjective, which in Italian should match both the number and the gender of the subject.
% We again consider four different conditions: feminine-feminine (FF), feminine-masculine (FM) masculine-feminine (MF) and masculine-masculine (MM), within which the number of the subject and attractor is ranomly varied.
% Similar to the NounPP task, we sample 1000 sentences per condition, using the word lists provided in Table~\ref{}.



% \dieuwke{May 2: I am a bit unclear here about how many sentences we generated accross which conditions (I think there are 4032?), I'll first ask Yair before finishing this.}
