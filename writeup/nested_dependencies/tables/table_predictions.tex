\caption{A summary of the predictions of model performance on successive and nested dependencies based on the sparsity of the long-range mechanism. Cell values represent the degree of predicted performance on the agreement task. Due to possible compensation mechanisms carried by the short-range number units, we make no precise predictions regarding performance on the embedded verb of Nested-Short.}
